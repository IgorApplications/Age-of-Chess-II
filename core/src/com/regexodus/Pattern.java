/**
 * A handle for a precompiled regular expression; core operations should be identical to java.util.regex.Pattern .
 * For closer compatibility with less-core features, see the regexodus.regex package.
 * <br>
 * To match a regular expression <code>myExpr</code> against a text <code>myString</code> one should first
 * create a Pattern object:<pre>
 * Pattern p = new Pattern(myExpr);</pre>
 * or <pre>
 * Pattern p = Pattern.compile(myExpr);</pre>
 * then obtain a Matcher object:<pre>
 * Matcher matcher=p.matcher(myText);</pre>
 * The latter is an automaton that actually performs a search. It provides the following methods:
 * <ul>
 * <li> search for matching substrings : matcher.find() or matcher.findAll();</li>
 * <li> test whether the text matches the whole pattern : matcher.matches();</li>
 * <li> test whether the text matches the beginning of the pattern : matcher.matchesPrefix();</li>
 * <li> search with custom options : matcher.find(int options);</li>
 * <li> replace simply : matcher.replaceFirst(String) or matcher.replaceAll(String) or matcher.replaceAmount(String, int);</li>
 * <li> for more complex replacement or to obtain a Replacer that should last, use the Pattern : p.replacer()</li>
 * </ul>
 * <br>
 * <b>Flags</b>
 * <br>
 * Flags (see REFlags interface) change the meaning of some regular expression elements at compile-time. Only Unicode
 * matching (for predefined char classes like {@code \\w}; doesn't affect user-defined Unicode character classes) is
 * enabled by default, but specifying the flags manually disregards the defaults.
 * These flags may be passed both as string(see Pattern(String,String)) and as bitwise OR of:
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>REFlags.IGNORE_CASE</b> - enables case insensitivity</li>
 * <li><b>REFlags.MULTILINE</b> - forces "^" and "$" to match both at the start and the end of line;</li>
 * <li><b>REFlags.DOTALL</b> - forces "." to match eols('\r' and '\n' in ASCII);</li>
 * <li><b>REFlags.IGNORE_SPACES</b> - literal spaces in expression are ignored for better readability;</li>
 * <li><b>REFlags.UNICODE</b> - the predefined classes('\w','\d',etc) are referenced to Unicode;</li>
 * <li><b>REFlags.XML_SCHEMA</b> - permits XML Schema regular expressions syntax extensions.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <br>
 * <b>Multithreading</b><br>
 * Pattern instances are not thread-safe, and neither are Matcher objects.
 * <br>
 * <b>Special Syntax</b>
 * <br>
 * RegExodus adds some features to Java's standard regexes and may not implement some rarely-used features, e.g.
 * possessive quantifiers. Syntax is mostly similar to PCRE's regexes, which Java's are also based on.
 * <br>
 * Here's all of it, as best as I can supply at 3 in the morning:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>A single character, unless it is a metacharacter, represents itself. "a" will match "a".</li>
 *     <li>Metacharacters affect regex behavior, and include:
 *     <ul>
 *         <li>'.' matches any single character on the same line (not a newline or carriage return), unless the DOTALL
 *         flag is enabled, in which it matches any character, including newlines and carriage returns.</li>
 *         <li>'^' means the start of the searched text.</li>
 *         <li>'$' means the end of the searched text, and has different meaning in a replacement string.</li>
 *         <li>'*' means the previous term can be repeated 0 or more times.</li>
 *         <li>'+' means the previous term can be repeated 1 or more times. Its meaning as a "possessive" modifier for
 *         repeating terms is <b>not supported</b>.</li>
 *         <li>'?' means the previous term can be repeated 0 or 1 times. It can also be placed after a repeating term,
 *         like "*", "+", or "?", to make it "reluctant." It also has special meaning in parentheses.</li>
 *         <li>'&#123;' and '&#125;' should be in matching pairs, and usually have an integer between them or two integers separated by a comma.
 *         One integer with no comma means the previous term should be repeated that many times exactly.
 *         Two integers, "&#123;a,b&#125;" with a comma mean the previous term should be repeated anywhere between a and b times, inclusive.
 *         One integer with a comma on either side acts as the two-integer case with no bound where the integer of a and b has been omitted.</li>
 *         <li>'(' and ')' in a matching pair define a group, and groups have extensive syntax of their own.</li>
 *         <li>'[' and ']' in a matching pair define a character class, which can match a single occurrence of one of
 *         multiple possible characters, possibly represented as ranges of characters. "[abc]" will match "a", "b", and
 *         "c". "[A-Z]" will match all upper-case English letters (it will not behave as intended if another language
 *         finds its way into your text). You can use shorthands defined with a backslash, listed below, in a character
 *         class most of the time (not \\b or other boundary matchers, nor \\Q and \\E). This means you could match all
 *         upper-case letters in just about any language with "[\\p&#123;Lu&#125;]", which is the same as without the
 *         brackets, but you could add additional parts to that, such as "[\\p&#123;Lu&#125;_]+" to match strings like
 *         "ABACUS_ÆTHỲŔ" (the '+' allows matching the whole string, and the extra '_' in the character class allows the
 *         whole thing to match). If a character class starts with '^', it negates the character class, matching any
 *         char that <b>isn't</b> one of the characters in the character class. If you need to match a literal '^', it
 *         can be at any point after the first character, or escaped with a backslash (which must be escaped in a String
 *         literal in source). If you neeed to match a literal '-', it can be the last item in the character class, or
 *         can be escaped similarly to the caret.</li>
 *         <li>'\\' (the single backslash, which usually needs to be escaped in source) can be used as an escape for
 *         other regex-specific terms, or to match a backreference to an earlier group. Backreferences are augmented in
 *         RegExodus, and you can do some useful and uncommon things with them. They are documented later, with groups.
 *         Regex-specific terms include the common \\w to match a word character (alphanumeric or underscore, by default
 *         respecting Unicode), \\b to match a boundary between a word character and a non-word character or the
 *         start/end of the text, \\d to match a digit, \\s to match a space, and capitalized versions of the previous
 *         ones mean the negation of them (like \\D is any non-digit character). You can also use \\x?? where ? is a hex
 *         digit to produce a char between Unicode 0 and 255, \\o???? where you can have 1 or more ? that are octal
 *         digits to produce a char by its code point as an octal number, \\m????? where you can have between 1 and 5
 *         decimal digits to produce a char by its code point as a normal base-10 number, and also \\u???? with exactly
 *         4 hex digits (similar to the escaping that Java will do on its own if you don't escape the backslash) and
 *         \\x&#123;????&#125; to do basically the same thing with a variable amount of ? as hex digits, but no more
 *         than 4 digits. In addition to the predefined character classes like \\w, there are Unicode categories,
 *         accessible with \\p? or \\p&#123;??&#125; , where the single ? is a group of categories like L for letters,
 *         P for punctuation, or N for numbers, and an upper-case-then-lower-case pair of ? in curly braces is an
 *         individual category like Ll for lower-case letters, Nd for decimal numbers, or Sc for currency symbols. Using
 *         \\p? will match any character in that category (), while \\P? will match any character not in that category.
 *         There's a good list here, http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/category/index.htm , including lists of
 *         which characters are in each category. RegExodus also supports Zh and Zv for horizontal and vertical spacing
 *         characters, respectively, as well as Js for Java identifier start (valid characters that can start a variable
 *         or class name in Java, including all letters, all underscore-like characters in Unicode category Pc, all
 *         currency characters in Unicode category Sc, and for some reason "letter numbers" like Roman numerals, but not
 *         any other numbers), Jp for Java identifier part (including everything in Js but also decimal digits in
 *         Unicode category Nd), and J as shorthand for Jp. Some other \\p... features may be supported, but not
 *         necessarily for the same version of Unicode that the categories support (Unicode 8.0.0 for categories here,
 *         in standard Java it isn't expected until Java 9). \\&lt; and \\&gt; can be used to match the start or end of
 *         a word (similar to \\b but only for one side). \\Q starts a literal escape in which metacharacters lose their
 *         special treatment and are matched like normal characters; this escape ends when the sequence \\E is reached.
 *         \\h, \\H, \\v, and \\V match horizontal whitespace, non-(horizontal whitespace), vertical whitespace, and
 *         non-(vertical whitespace), respectively; they behave like Java 8's handling of these escapes and not earlier
 *         versions (which matched a specific vertical tab character with \\v instead of all vertical whitespace). You
 *         can also use Zh and Zv for for horizontal and vertical categories. Java 8's \\R escape, which
 *         matches all line separators known in use, is not supported yet, but you can copy its behavior with
 *         "<code>(?:\\r\\n|[\\n\\x0C\\f\\r\\u0085\\u2028\\u2029])</code>" .
 *         </li>
 *     </ul>
 *     </li>
 *     <li>Groups are, as in most regex flavors, rather complicated. You can create a group with "(something)", which
 *     would match "something" and also store the text that matched the parenthesized section as a numbered group, here,
 *     group 1. Referencing these groups is covered next; RegExodus adds some features to backreferences that aren't
 *     present elsewhere. You can also name a group with the syntax "(&#123;NAME&#125;something)", which would again
 *     match "something" but this time would have the name "NAME", which allows you to reassign the contents of the
 *     remembered group's match for the purposes of later regexes. Reassignment uses the syntax
 *     "(&#123;=NAME&#125;something)", and can be done even if the group called "NAME" hasn't been found yet. If an
 *     earlier match to a repeated group like "((&#123;=NAME&#125;a+) ?)+" matched the "aa" in "aa a aaa aaa", finding
 *     all matches (the outer group with a '+') would finally cause the group with the name "NAME" to have the value
 *     "aaa", the last match to the named group. Groups can have many other kinds of special syntax, usually starting
 *     with a question mark as a metacharacter just after the opening parenthesis:
 *     <ul>
 *         <li>"?:" means a "plain group"; one that only keeps its contents together as a single unit for the purposes
 *         of repetition and other things like it, but doesn't remember the matched text for backreferences.</li>
 *         <li>"?=" means "positive lookahead"; it doesn't consume the text it matches but does require that text to be
 *         ahead for the regex to succeed.</li>
 *         <li>"?&le;" means "positive lookbehind"; it doesn't consume the text it matches but does require that text to be
 *         before the next part of the regex for the regex to succeed.</li>
 *         <li>"?!" means "negative lookahead"; it doesn't consume the text it matches but does require that text to NOT
 *         be ahead for the regex to succeed.</li>
 *         <li>"?&lt;!" means "positive lookbehind"; it doesn't consume the text it matches but does require that text to
 *         NOT be before the next part of the regex for the regex to succeed.</li>
 *         <li>"?&gt;" means an "atomic group"; it acts like a plain group in that it doesn't remember the matched text for
 *         backreferences, but it also tracks backreferences independently in itself, temporarily forgetting whatever is
 *         outside the independent, atomic group.</li>
 *         <li>"?#" means a comment in the regex; anything up until the closing parenthesis is ignored.</li>
 *         <li>"?imsuxX", where all of the letters are optional, changes the mode of the regex after that point. The "i"
 *         makes it case-insensitive, "m" makes "^" and "$" match the multi-line start and end of the text, instead of
 *         the start and end of a line. "s" makes "." match all characters, even line endings. "u" turns on Unicode
 *         handling for escapes like "\\w" and "\\b". "x" makes whitespace ignored in the regex, which can help
 *         legibility sometimes. "X" (capitalized) makes XML Schema terms allowed in "\\p" categories; "X" might not
 *         currently be working. You can add a ":" (and some text to match) after the letters to make a plain group that
 *         matches that text with the specified modes enabled, only for that group.</li>
 *         <li>"?(...)" means a "conditional group"; I'm not entirely sure what this does since it was present in JRegex
 *         before I forked it to make RegExodus. It seems to be related to PCRE's implementation of this feature, and
 *         works by checking if a group was matched earlier, and requiring an additional piece of text to be matched if
 *         an earlier group had successfully matched. I don't know all of its features.</li>
 *         <li>"?[...]" means a "class group"; this feature was present in JRegex before I forked it to make RegExodus,
 *         but from what I can tell it allows you to intersect, add to, and remove from character classes within the
 *         context of that group. For example, {@code Pattern.compile("(?[[\\pJ]-[\\pS]])")} will make a Pattern that
 *         starts with all characters that can appear in a Java identifier, marked by the category J, removes from what
 *         that matches all the symbol characters in Unicode category S (such as currency, which is valid in Java
 *         identifiers), and so yields all characters that can be in a Java identifier except for symbols. The '-' in
 *         the middle is what removes the second character class; it could be '+' to add another character class in, or
 *         '&amp;' to get the intersection of two character classes.</li>
 *     </ul>
 *     </li>
 *     <li>If a group matched some text, you may want to refer to that match later in the regex, or use it during a
 *     replacement. In replacement strings or in the matching regex itself, you can refer to what a group matched,
 *     though with slightly different syntax. In replacement strings, you can refer to a numbered group with "$?" where
 *     ? is a base-10 number with any number of digits, starting at 1. In a regex, you can make a backreference to an
 *     earlier group and what it matched with "\\?", where ? is again a base-10 number and refers to the text matched by
 *     the specified numbered group earlier in the regex. This could be used to match the text "HEY HEY" or "WHAT WHAT"
 *     with the example pattern "([A-Z]+) \\1", which would match the previous two examples but not "HEY WHAT". You can
 *     match a named group with the longer syntax "&#123;\\NAME&#125;" in a pattern or "$&#123;NAME&#125;" in a
 *     replacement string. This syntax also works with numbered groups (change "NAME" to "1", for example), and enables
 *     the special augmentations RegExodus adds:
 *     <ul>
 *         <li>Immediately before the name or number of the group ("NAME" in the examples), you can place one or more punctuation
 *         characters that (only in this context) change what the backreference is considered equivalent to.</li>
 *         <li>An at sign, {@literal @}, before the name or number of the group makes the match between the
 *         backreference and matched group case-insensitive. In replacement strings, this always makes the replacement
 *         lower-case. When matching and already case-insensitive, this does nothing.</li>
 *         <li>An exclamation point, {@literal !}, before the name or number of the group makes the match between the
 *         backreference and matched group case-insensitive. In replacement strings, this always makes the replacement
 *         upper-case. When matching and already case-insensitive, this does nothing.</li>
 *         <li>A slash, {@literal /}, before the name or number of the group makes the backreference match the group
 *         in reverse order, or reverses the group when used in a replacement string. This may have bad behavior with
 *         Unicode chars outside the first 65536 (the Basic Multilingual Plane), such as emoji.</li>
 *         <li>A colon, {@literal :}, before the name or number of the group makes any opening or closing parentheses
 *         or bracket-like characters match their closing or opening counterpart. Thus, "(" would be replaced with ")"
 *         and "〖〗" would be replaced with "〗〖" (it handles practically all of the Unicode Ps and Pe categories).
 *         </li>
 *         <li>Anywhere from none of these modifiers to all 4 can appear in a backreference; the order doesn't matter.
 *         </li>
 *     </ul>
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
 * <br>
 * I hope that answers at least some questions about the syntax extensions RegExodus makes.
